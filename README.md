# Keyboard-Controlled Mouse Project

This project allows you to control your mouse using your keyboard, providing a variety of functions such as moving the mouse cursor, simulating mouse scrolls, and clicking mouse buttons. The project is designed to run on Windows.

## Key Feature: Mode Switching

To enable keyboard control of the mouse, you must switch to control mode by pressing `Left Alt + 0`. In normal mode, the keyboard will function as usual without affecting mouse operations. Only in control mode will the keyboard simulate mouse actions.

## Features

- **Mouse Movement**:
  - Fast mode: Use `J`, `H`, `L`, `K` for down, left, right, and up respectively.
  - Slow mode: Use `S`, `A`, `D`, `W` for down, left, right, and up respectively.
  - **Speed levels**: Use `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5` to switch between speed levels `[1, 8, 24, 48, 64]`.

- **Mouse Scroll Simulation**:
  - Fast mode: Use `LSHIFT + J`, `LSHIFT + H`, `LSHIFT + L`, `LSHIFT + K` for down, left, right, and up respectively.
  - Slow mode: Use `LSHIFT + S`, `LSHIFT + A`, `LSHIFT + D`, `LSHIFT + W` for down, left, right, and up respectively.
  - **Speed levels**: Use `Shift + 1`, `Shift + 2`, `Shift + 3`, `Shift + 4`, `Shift + 5` to switch between speed levels `[1, 8, 24, 48, 64]`.

- **Mouse Clicks**:
  - Left Button Click: Primary - `I`, Secondary - `R`.
  - Right Button Click: Primary - `O`, Secondary - `T`.
  - Left Button Hold (drag): Primary - `C`, Secondary - `N`.

- **General Controls**:
  - Active Mode: `LALT + 0`
  - Quit Mode: `LALT + 0`
  - Toggle Control Mode: `LALT + 0`
  - Temporary Quit Mode: `Q`
  - Open Settings: `SPACE + COMMA`
  - Reset Settings: `LALT + R`
  - Force Quit: `LCONTROL + LSHIFT + A`
